description=The auto close doors feature has no way of knowing if you're already through the door, so it's a timed action, however I think 99.9% of the time you will be on the other side. If this is a problem for you you can disable this option in the sandbox settings.
description=Also, if you think the time of the timed action should be different, please let me know, thanks.
